Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README. 

I wasn't able to get the Loom embedding to work but I have uploaded a youtube video. I hope that is ok.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps
List of favorite applications: 
- Messages
    - Reliable 
    - Allows me to connect with people
    - Respect privacy with end to end encryption and good privacy policies. 
- Spotify 
    - Allows for offline sharing
    - Allows me to connect with people over shared music interests 
    - Has a large library that is easy to access. 
- Facetime 
    - Allows me to connect with people seamlessly
    - Highly reliable 
    - Everybody has it so there is no hassle in downloading it or creating an account. 

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

I would like to build an app that has a plethora of different types of sudoku games you can play. Currently, there only exists the standard sudoku and a few other specific forms but I believe that, if I were to expand the types of sudoku that you could play on device, I could garner a good user base of puzzle-enthusiasts. I'd probably have it pull down some model of the sudoku problems from a server I set up once every couple of levels and persist that onto the phone so that the games would work offline. Next I'd implement some way to check to see if a sudoku board is correct and a way to generate them in the backend. From there, I'd just implement the front-end of the app and have the player fill in the board that will direclty update some data structure. I could also implement hints and rewards at some point so there is something to build to.
